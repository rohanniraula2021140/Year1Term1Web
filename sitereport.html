            <h2>How do you start the web development? (Reflective Disscusion of My Module)
            </h2>
            <p>I can include the fact that is from 11th standard that I had learned HTML and CSS from W3 School and was assigned a project which I had submitted for the final term examination and I have scored A+ in that practical.</p>
            <p>Being frank, it is my first language that I had learned previously in six standard. At that time, I used to copy and paste the code from the book and enjoy the result. After doing same for long time I started to understand the term being used
                and why the tag are used in the specific place Then I used to create some website imagining I would create it in the future. I used to design the website in the copy and I would go for it There was also a time where I would have the perfect
                design but no way to fulfill it After then I used to leave the work by thinking it wasn’t for me or I can’t prepare it with my own.
            </p>
            <p>From then, my interest went down but I don’t know why I was in front of html without my will (can be called I was forced to meet it) in several different situation. Html and css were coming and hitting myself. I don’t know why it was so but
                I learned that my knowledge was not enough and my searching for the things were not in the right place. Then I came in the 11th standard where my knowledge got a bit more and it was the place where my projects and work were in next level(not
                much I thought) but its shape was changing. Then, One day I realized that in the past I was dreaming to be good in the web development when I was in front of my project and when I got strike by the problem then it would be just like notice
                for 2 day holiday.
            </p>
            <p>But in this module, I don’t remember where I heard but in this Term1 it was in my head that I shouldn’t leave the work though I get the problem. But we know we couldn’t play accurate at the first attempt but looking past about 12 Weeks in
                the term 1 one thing I am proud to say that I can stay much longer in front of web development problem than before thereby furnishing my skills. Taking technically, I was new to validators, GitHub. But my motto was about to change.
            </p>
            <h2>What I used to think before Module? (About Github)</h2>
            <p>I was afraid of this term. Why for this question, I got answer when I realized that previously, I was among the people who were not capable enough in GitHub. And like we know, living among the lion, attitude of sheep also uplifts. Samelike,
                being in this module I was forced to GitHub to which I was afraid of but turning pages to past, now I gotta know about reality and muchmore, I used it almost too all my web development project. Similarly, My book reading capability was
                increased. I read Jon docket html and CSS and several more.
            </p>
            <h2>Development of this Site</h2>
            <p>I had heard the fact that to take the copy and pen and start designing the structure and style in the paper with pencil so you get the basic idea about the project you will be doing in future.</p>
            <h3>Phase 1: Planning Phase</h3>
            <p class="datesite-site">11th May to 15th May</p>
            <p>Colliding yourself the with the paper with pencil, I started the drawing the design based on the instruction. I was changing numbers of the papers and I was like searching for the best design from the internet But first of all I created basic
                structure with the pencil and I was doing hit and trial method and I prepared a multiple design with the pencil and started merging into one. After 1-2 hours doing the same, I came up with responsive design. Then to make my design more
                appropriate and attractive I went to the internet and I found many like my one then I started to take my own interest structure and styles from it. After hour work my design was ended. And I referenced it too.
            </p>
            <h3>Phase 2: Implementing Phase</h3>
            <p class="datesite-site">15th May to 20th May</p>
            <p>As 3 days went off, I was sick a bit now I was back to my work thinking the planning completes the 50% of the work. But I was unknown that it was perfect plan which was responsible to complete the half of the work. First of all I created the
                structure of the index page(Using grid layout and with border line to make it visible about the columns they were taking.). I used the grid layout as it is more flexible then flex and definitely flexible than float. I went for styles where
                I think I most time in it. Why I don’t know but I used by most brain in it. But my brain consumption went good because my structure created by the HTML was best. As we know, good building requires good structure and the base and here html
                is the base. So, any color you paint in your house, design and beauty contributes equally to all.
            </p>
            <p>As already told my contact with GitHub was not much more before. But this module made me to use the branch feature and merge the different branches into the master one and I think the most enjoyable was the Git like it was providing the version
                control which was as interesting for me as it might be the reason I heard it for the first time. But I loved switching the branches and moving to previous changes and doing stuff and jumping forward and again moving backward. Previously
                I was doing file system which was too time taking as we need to copy the files into new folders to create the version which was annoying to.
            </p>
            <p>Then I was doing the Onedrive which would allow me to make my changes to master but it wouldn’t appropriate to compare these functionality with the Git. Then taking about the implementation of the html and CSS codes. It became easier to me
                to answer for why I am not certain but it might be the thing that I have done it previously so many times that a big or hard project is just like a matter of weeks.
            </p>
            <p>Then I went for the google fonts which I loved the facility. That they were providing the service in free and it has too much of fonts with much more styles And there is no limit up to how much you use you can use as much you like. They end
                user interface are so much good that everyone can use it very easily I would better thanks for the google for providing this kind of the stuff.
            </p>
            <h3>Phase 3: Ending Phase</h3>
            <p class="datesite-site">20th May to 31th May</p>
            <p>After two and half weeks of the work I completed the work which I was assigned for. I loved the journey in which someday I was in hospital's bed and someday I was doing it for 16 hours a day. After completing html and CSS codes I started for
                validation. It was boring for me to insert the each file each time and take the screen shot and place to the website. But whatever everything worth’s for web development assignment. Then I started to convert in the doc file for the turnitin
                submit. That was also a bit of time taking but again everything worth for the web development assignment.
            </p>
            <p>Then I went for video demonstration. It wasn’t the case like it was for me for the first time I had done it before but I still think it was the job which I had the less experience. It took me 8 retakes. However, I did with my full effort.
            </p>
            <p>Now looking 3 week back I was definitely afraid how I would complete the assignment but I am happy with my work. And I believe my work is not sufficient to make me a good web developer. On coming future I have to move for many steps and complete
                numerous goals. So this is my work I am presenting to my respected tutor. I know everything is not accurate it definitely has a mistake but I would still submit it to your attention.
            </p>
